1. step: clone the project to your local machine:
   <git clone https://github.com/luis72353/pokemon.git>

2. ALWAYS before starting to work on something and 
   occasionally in the meantime update your local 
   repository with changes from remote repository:
   <git pull>

3. How to commit & push changes you made:
   a) add changes designated for upload to your local
      stack:
      <git add <files to add>> (you can work with *)
   b) good style: put changes of specific scope into
      a single commit (locally). e.g. you fix a bug, 
      then commit only this minor change locally:
      <git commit -m "message">
   c) to upload your changes from local to remote 
      repository follow the following steps...
   d) ALWAYS update your local repository with all 
      changes from remote repository first before  
      uploading anything:
      <git pull>
   e) resolve conflicts if anything already changed
      in remote repository:
      <git merge> or directly fix it in the files
   f) if you were slow: pull & resolve (merge) again!
   g) finally push your changes to remote repository:
      <git push>
